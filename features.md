# DataFiction.Net
DataFiction.Net provides users of Fimfiction with useful data on stories and authors at a glance. All of its features can be turned on or off at the user's discretion through Fimfiction's local settings page.

A word of caution: there is no objective, quantitative way to properly judge the quality of a story or an author. Do not operate under the assumption that anything provided in this userscript can do so. The tools in this script are merely meant to provide users with an abundance of more accurate information. They can aid the decision-making process, but they shouldn't make your decisions for you.

## Features:
### Views/Vote
The views/vote feature displays the percentage of readers who have upvoted a story. This information is displayed at the end of story cards and beside the ratings bar on story pages. It will highlight green when above 10%, as this is about the average for stories of decent quality.

The views/vote percentage is **not** an objective measure of a story's quality. Rather, it is an indicator of a story's relative *success.* A well-marketed story will get a better percentage than a poorly-marketed one, and a story in a less popular genre or containing sensitive subjects may also have skewed results. In addition, more recent popular stories (such as those in the featured box) are likely to have higher percentages, but will gradually normalize as time goes on. Consider it a factor when deciding if a story may be worth reading.

### Followers/Fic
The followers/fic feature displays the ratio of followers to fics an author has accrued. This information is displayed in the tabs bar at the top of an author's page, and in parenthesis next to their follower count on their card. It will not display if an author has no stories.

The followers/fic ratio is influenced by many factors, including writing quality, marketing ability, blog quality, preexisting ability, social standing, and a smidge of dumb luck. Because of this, the followers/fic ratio is **not** an objective, end-all measure of the current strength of an author's writing so much as it is of the strength of their writing over their career. It can also be easily improved by deleting stories, so take it with a grain of salt.

### Personalized Reading Times
The personalized reading times feature provides estimated reading times of stories or groups of stories that are based on the user's provided reading speed. They are displayed in place of the existing estimate on search pages and bookshelves, and beside the total word count of stories on their pages. They are also slightly more precise than Fimfiction's estimate, and go up to years instead of stopping at weeks. 

The reading speed defaults to the national average of 250. To use this feature properly, you'll want to input your personal reading speed in words per minute (WPM) into the text field beside this option. To find your WPM, use this simple test: [What speed do you read?](https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/ereaders/speed-reader/iframe.html)
